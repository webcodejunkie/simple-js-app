This application is build with a _Pokemon API_ which will be linked here— [PokemonAPI](https://pokeapi.co/)

## This is a demo on the application -|- simply surf the list of pokemons of what generation you choose between the buttons. You could bring them up with left-clicking to show a modal on a more indepth look within the Pokemon

## This is my first sucessfully built JavaScript application, the following technologies that I've learned from JavaScript go far and beyond
